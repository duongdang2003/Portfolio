				I'm an independent gameplay and tools engineering contractor, currently
				based in Edinburgh, UK. I work with a wide variety of clients, from
				individuals looking for someone to build their dream game to independent
				studios and startups that need a talented professional to help to
				develop their projects. I graduated from Birmingham City University,
				with First-class Honours in BSc. Interactive Entertainment: Game
				Development, and have commercial AAA programming experience working as
				an Online Tools Designer at Rockstar North.

				If I'm not working hard with clients, I'm probably working on a personal
				project, participating in a game jam, powerlifting or exploring the
				gorgeous highlands of my local area.
