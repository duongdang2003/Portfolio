			I'm a student at Ton Duc Thang University currently studying Computer
			Network and Data Communication but my target is become a independent game
			developer. Throughout my academy journey, I have developed a strong
			foundation in programming languages such as C# and JavaScript, and skill
			in using game engines like Unity.
			<br />
			<br />
			As an independent contractor, I take a lot of joy in being able to
			continually work on a variety of different projects as it forces me to
			interact with new technologies, work with new people and consistently
			allow me to keep growing and learning. There's nothing like the freedom of
			being able to always work on the most interesting up-and-coming
			opportunities that present themselves to you. My passion truly lies in
			game development. I love being able to design and develop interactive
			experiences that can be enjoyed globally by a wide-range of different
			audiences. I also love being able to create and experiment with the
			development of indie tools, as it gives me a chance to try and give back
			to the community I work in and hopefully make the lives of my fellow
			developers easier.
			<br />
			<br />
			If I'm not working hard with clients, I'm probably working on a personal
			project, participating in a game jam, powerlifting or exploring the
			gorgeous highlands of my local area.
			<br />

				I'm always on the lookout for new clients with interesting projects to
				work on, so if you think that's you, send me an email!
